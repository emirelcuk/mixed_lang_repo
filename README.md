The empty `__init__` method just serves as a placeholder for you to add methods that handle calculations based on your needs.<br>4. **REST Route (`/commit_history/<int:commit_id>`)**  This route handles the logic for displaying commit details given the `commit_id`. We've used `request` parameter to access commit id. You can expand this function with more logic if needed. </p><p><br>**Key Points:**</p><p>* **Class-Based Structure:**  Use classes for organizing your code and its structure.<br>* **Documentation (`@app.route`)**: Use `@app.route` to map HTTP endpoints in your app, making it clear how to request this function/data.<br>* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `try...except` blocks (not shown here). </p><p><br>**To run the code:**</p><p>1. **Save the Code:** Save this code as a Python file (e.g., `best.py`).<br>2. **Start a Development Server:** Run: `python best.py`. You should see the message indicating that your development server is running.  <br>3. **Access in Browser**: Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/commit_history/<your_commit_id>`   (Replace `<your_commit_id>` with the actual commit ID). </p><p></p><p>Let me know if you have any specific calculation or logic in mind, or if you'd like help implementing a different function!</p>"""""""
